# imdc
A Python (3.8+) script to edit ImageDisk file (.IMD) comment headers.

This program displays, then edits, the comment header of an .IMD disk image.

## Usage

```
imdc.py file.imd
```

Comments must be fully contained within [code page 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437).

## Notes

The [original ImageDisk](http://dunfield.classiccmp.org/img/index.htm) (v1.18) generates files with this header format:

    IMD v.vv: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss          (ASCII Header)
    Comment (ASCII only - unlimited size)  (NOTE:  You can TYPE a .IMD)
    1A byte - ASCII EOF character          (file to see header/comment)

[Applesauce](https://applesaucefdc.com/) (as of v1.60b5) generates .IMD files with this header:

    IMD generated by Applesauce Fast Imager 2022-01-26T02:36:56.082Z
    
followed by the `0x1A` termination byte.

This utility was designed to work around Applesauce's lack of support for
the .IMD comment field.

As Dave Dunfield's `IMDA.COM` rejects files with headers > 8192 bytes, and Keir
Fraser's disk-utilities library rejects images with headers > 4096 bytes,
this utility limits the header to 4096 bytes.
